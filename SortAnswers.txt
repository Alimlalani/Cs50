sort1 uses: Bubble sort 

How do you know?: The running time of bubble sort in case of sorted list of elements is signifanctly lesser than that of the sort3,
so sort 1 is bubble sort 

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: The complexity of Merge sort is the fastest, so while working on random txt files the fastest real time was from sort2,
so sort 2 is Merge sort

sort3 uses: Selection sort 

How do you know?: The complexity of selection sort was slowest in all the txt cases, as selection sort has to go through each element one by one, 
therefore sort 3 is Selection sort
